## Legacy Zillow API material

Zillow still hosts older API terms describing the historical ZWSID-based Zillow
API family (home valuation, property details, mortgage, postings, reviews, and
directory calls):

<https://www.zillowgroup.com/developers/terms/>

That material is retained as historical context only. The current Data & APIs
portal above is the inventory used for new `az` work unless a live current
Zillow page explicitly points back to a legacy endpoint.

## Local source mirror

`docs/zillow/mirror-sources.tsv` contains the complete current portal inventory
plus the public documentation targets linked from it. Run:

```sh
ysh bin/zillow_mirror_documentation
```

The command writes fetched source pages under `.cache/zillow-documentation/`,
which is ignored by Git. Entries marked `linked-blocked` remain in the manifest
as provenance but are not fetched automatically.
